.jarvis.js
==========

.jarvis.js or Point Jarvis is a simple JavaScript library for speech recognition and text-to-speech using www.voicerss.org's API. Inspired from Tal Ater's annyang.js and Iron Man.


Why is the name Point Jarvis?
==========
Because this is just a part of Jarvis. Much like a part of 1: .1 .2 .3 .12312. There you go.

This project is under construction and not yet ready for projects. If you want to help, just create an issue. Thanks.
